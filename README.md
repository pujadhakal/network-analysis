Extensive network analysis using the Helsinki City Bike dataset that is available on Kaggle.

In this proposal, the focus is on conducting an in-depth network analysis utilizing the Helsinki City Bike dataset available on Kaggle. The primary goal is to enhance the effectiveness of Helsinki's bike-sharing program by optimizing station locations and simplifying intricate relationships within the network. The proposed approach involves a systematic examination of the dataset, beginning with thorough cleaning and preparation. Utilizing graph theory and network analysis tools, the project aims to visualize bike stations and user travel patterns, emphasizing key routes and popular stations. Machine learning techniques will be employed to forecast usage patterns, predicting peak times and station demands. Geospatial visualization tools will then be used to create accessible maps and graphs for stakeholders. The anticipated outcome is to provide actionable insights for station placement, route planning, and user engagement, aligning with Helsinki's commitment to sustainable urban mobility and contributing to data-driven solutions for the city's future transportation regulations.
